        <h1>Area</h1>

        <p>
           In this section, you will be able to choose the area of choice to extract geographical data from. The area of choice can be selected by drawing a bounding box (with rectangular shape). This bounding box will wrap around the area of your choice, including the numeric value of longtitude and latitude.
        </p>

        <p>
            This window area contains the interactive map that illustrates the surface of the earth, looking from satelite. The map is provided by the arcGIS map API. Below is an overview of the interactive map window.
