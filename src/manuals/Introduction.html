        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        
        <p>The Climate Futures data portal allows for easy access to 150Tb of climate data based on filters set by the user.</p>
        
        <p>The climate database and data portal system is maintained by the <a href="https://climatefutures.org.au/">Climate Futures team</a>.</p>

        <p>
            In this application, climate data may be searched and downloaded by setting the following filters:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <b>Spatial extent</b>: A rectangular geospatial area of which to search for climate data.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Time period</b>: A period of time defined by 2 dates, to search within.
