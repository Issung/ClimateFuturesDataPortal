    <h><b>Introduction</b></h>
    <p>
        This web-based application contains a front-end that would allow you 
        to discover what data is available and extract what you desire.
    </p>

    <p>
        In this application, you can extract data subset with the following attributes:
        <br>- Variables: humidity, temperature, wind direction, etc. There are up to 100 variables.
        <br>- Spatial extent: single location, a bounding box, or a defined polygon (geospatial file).
        <br>- Time period: single time slice, or a period of time from start to end that is defined by you.
        <br>- Ensemble part: all models or only a subset.        
    </p>

    <p>
        Futhermore, the system will inform you of the approximate data request size prior to initiating extraction.
