    <p>
        Climate Futures is basically a data portal which is used for providing climate related data to anyone based upon request. 
        This vary idea was initiated by The Climate Future Team to bring a faster data processing system.
        This web-based application contains a front-end that would allow you 
        to discover what data is available and extract what you desire.
    </p>

    <p>
        In this application, you can extract data subset with the following attributes:
        <ul>
            <li>      
                Variables: humidity, temperature, wind direction, etc. There are up to 100 variables.
            </li>
            <img alt="variable" src="img/Variable.jpg" width="700" height="333"/>
            <br>
            <br/>
            <li>
                Spatial extent: single location, a bounding box, or a defined polygon (geospatial file).           
            </li>
            <br>
            <img alt="variable" src="img/Spatial_extent.JPG" width="400" height="150"/>
            <br>
            <br/>
            <li>
                Time period: single time slice, or a period of time from start to end that is defined by you.
            </li>
            <br>
            <img alt="variable" src="img/Time_period.JPG" width="400" height="150"/>
            <br>
            <br/>
            <li>
                Ensemble part: all models or only a subset.                      
            </li>
            <br>
            <img alt="variable" src="img/ensemble_part.JPG" width="700" height="333"/>
            <br>
            <br/>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
        Futhermore, the system will inform you of the approximate data request size prior to initiating extraction.
