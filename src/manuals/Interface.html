    <p>
     Introduction of the interface of the application.
    </p>
<ul>
<li>
    Area selection
</li>
<p>
This area contains the section where you can proceed your location selection for data extraction. 
It contains a map API from ArcGIS and functionality the team implements to help you choose area of your choice, either by square or importing a shapefile. 
</p>

</ul>
    <p>
        In this application, you can extract data subset with the following attributes:
        <ul>
            <li>      
                Variables: humidity, temperature, wind direction, etc. There are up to 100 variables.
            </li>
            <li>
                Spatial extent: single location, a bounding box, or a defined polygon (geospatial file).           
             </li>
            <li>
                Time period: single time slice, or a period of time from start to end that is defined by you.
            </li>
            <li>
                Ensemble part: all models or only a subset.                      
            </li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
        Futhermore, the system will inform you of the approximate data request size prior to initiating extraction.
