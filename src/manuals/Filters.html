        <h1>Time & Variables</h1>
        <p>
            This section allows you to choose the filters for the chosen area of choice in the previous steps. These filters will be the criteria for your download, including: Time Period, Time Resolution, Ensemble, Emission and a list of Geographical Variables.
        </p>
        <h2>Time Period</h2>
        <p>
            Select a specific time period for your data. For example, you can select 20/05/1999 for the start date 
            and select 10/06/2000 in the end of date. The selection means the data includes variable information between 
            20th May 1999 to 10th June 2000. 
        </p>
        <p>
            If you want to get just one day climate data, you can select the start date, and the end date will be automatically set as the same.
        </p>
        <p>
            You cannot, however, choose an end date that is before the start date. You will be prompt with a warning if you try to proceed further.

        <h2>Time Resulation</h2>
        <p>
            When selecting the time resolution, you can click the time resolution selection box with the left mouse button.
        </p>

        <p>
            Select the desired time resolution in the pop-up drop-down menu.
        </p>

        <p>
            The Time Resolution option consists of 3 options: Daily, Hourly and Monthly.</p>
        </p>

        <p>
            This function determines how many chunks will be downloaded within a timeframe chosen previously in Time Period.
        </p>

        <p>
            E.g: A time period of 3 30-day months, with hourly time resolution will result in 3*30*24 = 2160 chunks of data.
        </p>

        <h2>Ensemble</h2>
        <p>
            The user can select an ensemble member for the result of the data. There are seven ensemble members for selection.
        </p>

        <p>These ensemble members include the following:

            Ensemble basically means convention and variation which different organizations or individuals of climate research use to represent their dataset. The user must be able to choose different ensemble members, which will ensure that the dataset to be downloaded will be modelled in different ways from different people, ensuring non-bias scientific results.
