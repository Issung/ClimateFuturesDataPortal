    <h1>Step 2 â€“ Time and Variables</h1>
	<h2>Variables area</h2>
	<p>There are hundreds of the variables in the variable list, each variable presents a kind of climate data. 
	You can click the cycle which following the variable name to select the variables for your data set.</p>
	<h2>Variable filter</h2>
	<p>The variable filter can quick filter the variables which you wanted. Enter the first few letters of the 
	variable name in the filter text box, the variable list will show the variables which name match your
	 typing in the filter box.</p>
	<h2>Time area</h2>
 	<p>Select a specific time period for your data. For example, you can select 20/05/1999 for the start date 
	and select 10/06/2000 in the end of date. The selection means the data includes variable information between 
	20th May 1999 to 10th June 2000. If you want to get just one day climate data, you can select the same day 
	which you wanted for both start date and end date.</p>
	<h2>Ensemble member area</h2>
 	<p>You can select any ensemble member for your data by the drop menu of the ensemble member.</p>
	<h2>Ensemble members</h2>
 	<p>Similarly to mathematical formulas, passing different data parameters through specific calculation methods
	will organise the data in a more intuitive layout to help users better analyse the information. The directory
	structure currently used by the Climate Futures team to organise the NetCDF files separates the files by ensemble model. </p>
