    	<h2>Step 3 - Summary & Download</h2>
    	<p>In the 3rd and final step, you may review all of your selected filters for mistakes, and will also be informed of logical errors if any have occurred, such as forgetting to select an area, or selecting a start date that comes after the selected end date. </p>
    	<h3>Selection Summary</h3>
    	<p>All selected filters will be summarised in this section, allowing you to check for errors or being informed of logical errors preventing you from searching.</p>
    	<img alt="summary of the filters chosen in previous steps" src="img/summary.png">
    	<p>Once satisfied with the filters you have chosen, you can proceed by clicking on the <b>Search Data</b> at the bottom to commence the searching operation for your files.</p>
    	<img alt="search data button" src="img/search-data.png">
    	<h3>Downloadable Contents</h3>
    	<p>After pressing the <b>Search Data</b> button, a pop-up will appear and will load while waiting for search results to return. </p>
    	<p>Please wait patiently while the application searches through the Climate Futures’ database for data matching your filters, keeping in mind the more variables you have selected the longer your search will take.</p>
    	<img alt="waiting pop up whilst the application search for data in the database" src="img/waiting-pic.png">
    	<p>Once searching is complete all files found containing data within your filters will be displayed on screen in lists, separated into tabs by time resolution. </p>
    	<p>The time resolution you selected in step 2 will be the default tab selected, but other tabs can be viewed in case you view other found results.</p>
    	<p>The tabs display a number in brackets such as “(2)”, this indicates how many results there are in that tab.</p>
    	<p>The “Other” tab contains files found that do not fit into hourly, daily, monthly or static, a time resolution to often find in the “other” tab for example is 3 hourly.</p>
    	<p>Left click on one of the blue list items in order to begin downloading it, your browser may automatically save it in your downloads folder or ask you to specify a save location.</p>
    	<img alt="results of downloadable contents for preselected filters and area" src="img/search-data-results.png">
    	<p>It is important to note that files returned will contain data within your search filters, but will likely also contain data form outside your filters too. Extra data will often be outside of your time range or outside of your area selection, all other data (variables, ensemble, etc) should be an exact match to your filters.</p>
    	<h3>Filename Formats</h3>
    	<p>
    		Files retrieved follow a filename formatting scheme, as outlined below:
    		<ol>
    			<li><b>Variable Code</b>: This is often an abbreviation or bears resemblance to the full variable name. In this example below “prc” is the variable code for Convective Precipitation.</li>
    			<li><b>Ensemble</b>: The ensemble model of the data in the file, will correspond to your selected ensemble filter in step 2.</li>
    			<li><b>Emission</b>: The emission of the climate data in the file, will correspond to your selected emission filter in step 2.</li>
    			<li>
    				<b>Time Resolution</b>: The time resolution of the data in the file, this can be:
    				<ul>
    					<li>“1hr” = Hourly</li>
    					<li>“day” = Daily</li>
    					<li>“mon” = Monthly</li>
    					<li>“fx” = Static</li>
    				</ul>
    				Other time resolutions can occasionally appear (e.g. 3hr) and their meaning can be guessed at or found out by looking at the data in the file. Remember that the smaller the time resolution, the more records will be in the file, 
    			</li>
    			<li><b>Start Date</b>: The start date of the data in the file, in yyyy/mm/dd format.</li>
    			<li><b>End Date</b>: The end date of the data in the file, in yyyy/mm/dd format.</li>
    			<li><b>File Format</b>: The file format of the file, this will always be .nc (NetCDF) but could change in future.</li>
    		</ol>
